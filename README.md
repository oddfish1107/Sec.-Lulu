> Stop looking up words. Start living them.
In the flow of reading or browsing, every unfamiliar word is an opportunity lost to the friction of switching tabs.
Sec. Lulu - an AI language learning assistant - hopes to bridge that gap by **recording new words as you go** (clipboard or OCR), tailoring them into a **structured learning program** just for you. Instead of static dictionary entries, you receive AI-driven insights, usage examples, and creative stories that turn abstract characters into memorable concepts.

The setup is local, no cloud, no data collection. Just you and your language learning journey.
