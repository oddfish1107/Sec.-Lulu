> Stop looking up words. Start living them.
In the flow of reading or browsing, every unfamiliar word is an opportunity lost to the friction of switching tabs. Sec. Lulu - an AI language learning assistant - hopes to bridge that gap by **recording new words as you go** (clipboard or OCR), tailoring them into a **structured learning program** just for you.

Instead of static dictionary entries, you receive AI-driven insights, usage examples, and creative stories that turn abstract characters into memorable concepts.</p>

The setup is local, no cloud, no data collection. Just you and your language learning journey.

**Currently supporting:**

- Chinese

## Features

- Monitors clipboard for new words
- Organises word learning data into a personal profile
- *Daily "What you learned" summaries with tips, reviews and exercises (in progress*)

### Modes

- **Lookup-only**: fastest, searches individual words on local dictionary
- **Simple**: fast, short,concise response from AI
- **Detailed**: immersive response from AI

**To-Do:**

- [x] **Anki-based** word review session
- [x] Home: Better "What you learned" summaries (scrollable box, update AI profile)
- [x] Improved challenge+summary  ~~(change to: mixed language maybe?)~~
- [x] Integrated lookup mode(word hover: show translation + quick def) 
- [ ] EasyOCR integration because Powertoys OCR messed it up sometimes
- [ ] What does "Save word" a sentence do??
- [ ] (integrated revision, better explanation on long-complex sentences)
- [ ] Renewed UI
- [ ] ~~AI flexibly blending both languages (When a volcano erupts, magma will喷出 from the volcano's口)~~
- [ ] More test cases for each mode for debugging
- [ ] More features

- [ ] Initial clipboard data isn't sent
- [ ] Card UI
- [ ] TTS
- [ ] Bunch of db.py and reviewer.py errors
- [ ] Removing None from ControlPanel breaks everything

## Tech stack
